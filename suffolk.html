                <h2>Acknowledgements</h2>
                <p>This manual is the result of the collective efforts of many individuals; each working together to develop a state-of-the-art set of clinical protocols that meet the New York State Emergency Medical Advisory Committee (SEMAC) standard of care. The revisions published in this manual, to the original Suffolk County Advanced Life Support (ALS) Protocols, reflect both advancements in modern technology and progressions made in Continuous Quality Improvement and Education and Training of ALS Providers within the Suffolk County EMS System.</p>
                <p>The clinical protocols documenting the prehospital approach to patients contained herein is in line with the current recommendations promulgated by the American Heart Association (AHA), the Regional Trauma Advisory Committee (RTAC), the American College of Surgeons Committee on Trauma (ACS-COT), are endorsed by the Regional Emergency Medical Advisory Committee (REMAC) and officially approved by the NY State Emergency Medical Advisory Committee (SEMAC); and the Regional EMS System Medical Director.</p>
                <p>Thanks to Dr. Gregson Pigott, Dina Wayrich, Christopher Nuccio, Raegin Kellermann, Karl Klug and Darrell Berezny at the Suffolk County Department of Health Services, Emergency Medical Services (EMS) Division, for their efforts in researching, editing, creating new appendices and fact sheets, and working to develop this manual.</p>
                <p>Special thanks to William Michael Masterton, Protocol Revision Project Manager, who worked diligently to ensure that our protocols remain state-of-the-art in recognition of the desire to ensure that our Emergency Medical Technician-Basics (EMT-Bs), Emergency Medical Technician-Critical Cares (EMT-CCs) and Emergency Medical Technician-Paramedics (EMT-Ps) can provide the best possible patient care.</p>
                <p>Special thanks to Dr. Lincoln Cox and Dr. Trevor Marshall, as the REMAC's Protocol Sub-Committee Co- Chairmen, and their committee. Each has spent countless hours of their own time ensuring that these protocols were consistent with New York State standards of care, their experiences and philosophies in emergency medicine, and for their appreciation of the skillset of EMT-CCs and EMT-Ps. Special thanks as well to Dr. Jason Winslow, immediate past REMAC chair, and Dr. Max Minnerop, current REMAC chair, for their leadership in supporting this endeavor.</p>
                <p>Special thanks to David Sterne, EMT-P from the Setauket Fire District, who generously dedicated many hours of his own time researching material, developing the new protocol format, and creating and editing protocols.</p>
                <p>With admiration and appreciation, this protocol manual revision is dedicated to Chief Thomas Lateulere, whose efforts continue to serve as the foundation for the clinical protocols contained herein.</p>

                <h2><a name="A-INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION</a></h2>
                <p>The Suffolk County Emergency Medical Services (EMS) System is an organized and integrated system consisting of ambulance services, first responder services, emergency physicians, specialty physicians, hospitals, other support services and personnel providing patient care through approved patient care protocols under the supervision of the designated EMS System Medical Director (Medical Director) and the Suffolk County Department of Health Services, EMS Division, as the designated Regional EMS Program Agency.</p>
                <p>Although in this home-rule New York (NY) State and in recognition of the duties and powers of other municipalities that operate or contract for ambulance services, we work together in the unified Suffolk County EMS System. Within the EMS System, out-of-hospital emergency medical care is the delegated practice of medicine, whereby non-physicians, with the appropriate certifications, credentialing, and authorizations, are empowered by the Medical Director to provide patient care under the direction and control of a licensed physician. Direction may be provided “on-line” (direct, radio or telephone contact) with a supervising physician, or “off-line” pursuant to standing orders and protocols. This care may be provided at the scene of a medical emergency and/or during transportation of the ill or injured to a hospital.</p>
                <p>The Suffolk County EMS System's <b>Advanced Life Support (ALS) Protocol Manual (the “Manual”)</b> serves as the reference for patient care within the Regional EMS System. It is intended to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Define the standard of care and establish quality assurance and quality improvement procedures for the System;</li>
                    <li>Guide personnel in delivering the highest standard of emergency medical care in a safe environment; and</li>
                    <li>Encourage the interdisciplinary approach to emergency medical care.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The <b>Manual</b> is divided into the three (3) sections identified below:</p>
                <b>A. GENERAL ADMINISTRATIVE POLICIES:</b>
                <p>This Section contains the administrative and operating policies and procedures for the Suffolk County EMS System.</p>
                <b>B. MEDICAL PROTOCOLS:</b>
                <p>This section contains the clinical medical treatment protocols that govern advanced level prehospital emergency medical care in our EMS System. There is a single set of ALS protocols used by Emergency Medical Technician-Critical Cares (EMT-CCs) and Emergency Medical Technician-Paramedics (EMT-Ps), with treatment options per certification level, followed by Medical Control options, clearly delineated. The medical protocols contained in this <b>Manual</b> are <i>intended for the emergency prehospital care environment and are not to be used on inter-facility transports.</i></p>
                <p>The <b>Manual</b> has been updated with broad-based, interdisciplinary input, and represents a regional consensus of opinion on the application of emergency medical care, and meets the standard of care defined by the New York State Emergency Medical Advisory Committee (SEMAC). The protocols contained in the <b>Manual</b> are predicated on the presence of a single ALS Provider. In cases where multiple ALS Providers are present, concurrent application of procedures is encouraged, concurrent with Medical Control contact, when indicated. Guidelines for pediatric patients are more fully described in Section B, II, and in the appendices section of the manual.</p>
                <b>C. APPENDICES:</b>
                <p>It is important to note that while limited protection from liability is afforded by Article 30 of the New York State Public Health Law (PHL), and financial protection is provided by various forms of insurance written for participants in the EMS System, such protection is not intended to extend to an individual who, or agency which, fails to adhere to the standard of care specified in this <b>Manual</b>.</p>
                <p>While an attempt has been made to provide policies, protocols and “how-to” appendices for most eventualities, situations may arise which have not been addressed in this <b>Manual</b>. In such cases, field personnel and Medical Control Physicians must use their training and good judgment to provide interventions which meet the accepted standard of care and which is within the scope of their certification or licensure.</p>
                <p>This <b>Manual</b> has been reviewed and approved for use in the Suffolk County Emergency Medical Services System.</p>

                        <p>Responsibility for all aspects of out-of hospital patient care provided within the Suffolk County EMS System rests with the EMS System Medical Director. All such patient care is provided as an extension of the Medical Director's license to practice medicine. Ambulance Service-level Medical Directors are responsible for quality improvement and educational initiatives on a local level with each of his/her respective ambulance services. Prehospital emergency medical care at the Basic Life Support (BLS) level generally does not involve on-line physician intervention. <u>BLS protocols and policies do contain Medical Control Options in certain specific circumstances</u>, requiring Medical Control contact when directed. BLS personnel are encouraged to contact Medical Control for on-line physician assistance whenever questions arise regarding treatment and/or transport options, and are <u>required</u> to register specific interventions with Medical Control after the call.</p>
                        <p>Advanced Life Support (ALS) providers certified at EMT-Critical Care (EMT-CC) or EMT-Paramedic (EMT-P) level, provide Advanced Life Support (ALS) under the standing orders defined in the <b>Manual</b> or under the direction of an <b>On-Line Medical Control Physician</b> or a <b>Designated EMS Field Physician</b>. The Medical Control Physician or Designated EMS Field Physician is responsible for the care of a patient entered into the ALS System. The physician's obligation is to apply the standard of care presented in the <b>Manual</b> to the individual patient care situation. An <b>On-Line Medical Control Physician</b> is a physician authorized by the Medical Director to provide advice and direction to ALS Providers providing out-of-hospital medical care. A <b>Designated EMS Field Physician</b> is a physician authorized by the EMS System Medical Director and the Regional Emergency Medical Advisory Committee (REMAC) to provide advice and direction when such physician is present at the scene of an out-of-hospital medical emergency. A <b>Disaster Medical Response Team (DMRT) Physician</b> is a physician receiving additional authority as a Deputy Fire Coordinator-Medical (DFC- Medical) to operate as an agent of the county, when specifically called upon.</p>

                        <p>Contact with Medical Control is required in specific circumstances, and based on the level of certification of the provider(s) treating the patient, whenever an advanced, diagnostic, or therapeutic procedure is performed. In <b>all</b> cases where ALS is performed, a post-call telephone call (Signal 34) to Medical Control to register the call with the system is required, as soon as feasible after the call. Failure to contact Medical Control when required to do so by protocol increases liability and risk for the ALS Provider and the ambulance service. <b><u>Once an IV is attempted, the cardiac monitor is applied, prehospital medications are administered, or patients are assisted with their own prescribed medications, as specified by specific protocol, the ALS Provider must follow the applicable ALS protocol and continue care of the patient until arrival at the hospital. Notable exception is for patients who have received prehospital Narcan if certain conditions have been met as are outlined in Part 16 section D of this manual.</u></b></p>
                        <p>When required by protocol, voice contact with Medical Control should be established as promptly as possible, <b>but not more than 20 minutes</b>, after technician-patient contact is established. Communication with Medical Control should not delay the initiation of appropriate care authorized under Standing Orders.</p>
                        <p>Following 12 lead acquisition by an EMT-B or EMT-CC, the provider <b>must transmit and contact Medical Control</b> at once. EMT-Ps <b>must transmit and contact Medical Control</b> at once if 12 lead shows STEMI. Providers of all levels should make the pre-arrival notification to the receiving hospital as soon as feasible, and before they begin transport, to pass along information regarding a positive STEMI.</p>
                        <p>Medical Control may be reached by cellular or landline telephone at 631-689-1430, or by using the 800 MHz radio system by “hailing” Medical Control on the talk group identified as “ALS CALL.” Medical Control will direct the caller to the available talk group, MEDCONTROL 1 or MEDCONTROL 2, where technician-to- physician conversation can take place. (MEDCONTROL 3 and 4 are reserved for future use, or for use as directed by a representative of the Suffolk County EMS Division, or Suffolk County FRES.).</p>
                        <p>In the event that contact cannot be made by cellular telephone <b>OR</b> 800 MHz radio, prehospital personnel may contact Medical Control via VHF channel 4 (155.175MHz) on the Medcom radio. <u><b>NOTE:</b> Refusal of Medical Assistance (RMA) consults, as more fully described in Section 5 below, must take place on the telephone.</u></p>
                        <p>If a system-wide communications system failure occurs, the EMS Division may institute the Catastrophic Communications Failure Policy. If activated, and an ALS Provider is unable to establish contact with Medical Control, the ALS Provider may only perform those procedures authorized as <b>Standing Orders</b> in the applicable protocol. In these cases, EMT-Paramedics may repeat their standing orders, based on patient needs while enroute to the hospital. EMT-Critical Cares may only follow their own standing orders while enroute to the hospital.</p>
                        <p>An ALS Provider has the right to question an order that is believed to be contraindicated or for which the ALS Provider is not certified. The ALS Provider should clarify the order and restate the patient's condition. If the order is not altered or retracted, the ALS Provider must carry out the order unless he/she is not credentialed or trained in that intervention, or if that intervention is not listed in the formulary of authorized procedures. Any such action should be referred to the EMS System Medical Director as soon as possible for review.</p>

                        <p>Article 30 of the NYS Public Health Law and Part 800 of the NYS EMS Code require that voice communications <b><u>and</u></b> bio-telemetry capability be available as part of any ALS System for technician-to- physician communication, including transmission of dynamic real-time three (3) lead rhythm strips and twelve (12) lead data-stored electrocardiograms. The use of cellular telephones or other devices with telemetry capability are considered acceptable for contact with Medical Control and ALS services are required to maintain telemetry-transmitting capabilities. It is each agency's responsibility to ensure that they have the necessary peripheral equipment needed for the specific cardiac/monitor in use.</p>

                        <p>Medical Control may be accessed by any prehospital provider while on duty status with an authorized agency on an emergency medical alarm <b><u>at any time</u></b> for consultation and advice regarding patient care including, but not limited to, questions about triage, questions regarding diversion requests, treatment, selection of destination hospital, appropriateness of medevac utilization, and refusal of medical assistance. Contact with Medical Control <b><u>is required</u></b> in specific protocols, based on the level of certification of the provider(s) taking care of the patient.</p>
                        <li><a name="STANDING ORDERS">STANDING ORDERS</a>:</li>
                        <p>Standing Orders identify actions that may be taken by field personnel under specific medical protocols, based on level of certification of the provider(s) treating the patient, prior to contact with Medical Control. <b>STANDING ORDERS ARE WRITTEN WITH THE ASSUMPTION THAT THERE IS A SINGLE ALS PROVIDER AND THEREFORE MUST BE PERFORMED IN THE ORDER PRESENTED</b>. If there is more than one ALS provider providing care, the standing orders may be applied concurrently to facilitate good patient care. Procedure attempts are limited to <b><u>TWO (2)</u></b> attempts per patient. <b><u>Once standing orders are initiated in a particular protocol, the ALS Provider is obligated to that protocol.</u></b></p>
                        <p><b><u>ALS Providers must contact Medical Control if a patient's condition changes and interventions from additional protocols are needed.</u></b> The exception to this rule concerns the use of supraglottic airways. An ALS Provider may insert a REMAC-approved Supraglottic airway prior to attempting endotracheal intubation if he/she assesses the patient, if the patient meets criteria for supraglottic airway and if he/she believes that intubation will be difficult or not possible.</p>
                        <p>In cases where there are two (2) ALS Providers treating a patient in a protocol that does not have an advanced airway as a standing order, who suddenly requires an advanced airway (ETT or supraglottic), an ALS Provider may secure the airway as clinically indicated up to their level/agency level of advanced airway privileges.</p>
                        <p>In cases where there are BLS Providers trained in acquiring and transmitting 12-lead EKG, the use of a BLS provider to perform this skill, when working with an ALS provider performing advanced assessment or therapies, is encouraged. This facilitates good patient care by allowing concurrent activity, thereby reducing time.</p>
                        <p><b>With the exception of defibrillation of the patient who develops Ventricular Fibrillation or Pulseless Ventricular Tachycardia,</b> once contact with Medical Control has been established, Standing Orders, unless specifically stated otherwise in the protocol, are no longer valid. The Medical Control physician is responsible for all subsequent treatment decisions, including the transport decision.</p>
                        <p>If the ALS Provider has initiated treatment in a particular CARDIAC ARREST protocol, and the patient condition necessitates change to a different CARDIAC ARREST protocol, or the SHOCK/HYPOPERFUSION AFTER ROSC PROTOCOL, the ALS Provider(s) may switch protocols <b><i>one (1) time</i></b>, carry out standing orders for that protocol, AND CONTACT MEDICAL CONTROL.</p>
                        <p>The use of IO insertion as a procedure for infusing fluids and administering medications is applicable to ADULT and PEDIATRIC PATIENTS. ALS Providers primary insertion site is the upper extremity at the humeral head. If unable to access the upper extremities, the secondary insertion site is the lower extremity at the proximal tibia.</p>
                        <p>The use of SALINE LOCKS as a procedure to keep the vein open, or infuse fluids or medications, may be used when the patient's condition requires a port for potential emergency access, limited fluids or does not require multiple medication administrations. Prior to establishing a Saline Lock, the provider must consider whether the patient will decompensate to the point of requiring fluid resuscitation or is acutely ill enough to require multiple IV medication administration. In those cases, an IV should be established.</p>

                            <li><b>Designated EMS Physicians:</b> On occasion, a physician may be present at the scene of an out-of-hospital emergency. The EMS Medical Director, a Medical Control Physician, or a Designated EMS Field Physician may provide on-scene medical control in accordance with System protocols. The primary role of these physicians is to provide direct on-scene medical control and direction, not to perform hands-on clinical care. If the physician does provide hands-on clinical care, the physician must be so designated by their ambulance service, and is doing so in accordance with their professional licensure and professional liability insurance coverage limits.<br />
                            <br />These physicians may accompany the patient to the hospital but <b>are not obligated to</b> do so. All procedures and medications performed or administered by the physician must be clearly documented on the PCR or electronic equivalent. A list of Designated EMS Field Physicians is listed in the appendices section of this manual.</li>
                            <li><b>Disaster Medical Response Team (DMRT)</b> members are Designated EMS Field Physicians who also hold additional credentials that include: duly authorized by the Suffolk County EMS Division; credentialed by the Suffolk County Department of Health Services Compliance Unit; and appointed by Suffolk County Fire, Rescue & Emergency Services (FRES) as Deputy Fire Coordinator-Medical. In this capacity, physicians may act as agents of the county, only when specifically called to duty by the county.<br />
                            <br />Any clinical care provided is in accordance with their professional licensure and professional liability insurance coverage limits. All procedures and medications performed or administered by the physician must be clearly documented on the PCR or electronic equivalent. DMRT Physicians/Designated EMS Field Physicians may be useful in MCI situations, technical rescues, buildings evacuated due to “strange odors,” active violence, or other large-scale complex incidents requiring extensive emergency incident rehabilitation (Rehab) efforts.</li>
                            <li><b>Other Physicians:</b> In the event that a non-designated physician is at the scene and wishes to assume responsibility for the care of his/her patient in his/her office, or as a passer-by at the scene of a call, the physician must be properly identified. Acceptable forms of identification include, but are not limited to, a medical society card, professional organization membership card, or hospital identification card. Until proper identification has been established, the ALS Provider shall render care to the patient in the usual manner.<br />
                            <br />To assume responsibility for the care of a patient, an on-scene physician must agree to assume all responsibility for the patient, document the assumption of responsibility on the Prehospital Care Report (PCR), and agree to accompany the patient to the hospital <b>in the ambulance.</b><br />
                            <br />If the on-scene physician agrees to these terms, the physician's orders may be carried out. However, such orders must conform to the level of training of the field personnel and to the protocols established in the <b>Manual</b>.<br />
                            <br />Orders that are not within established Suffolk County EMS System policy or protocol, or those that are out of the scope of practice of an EMT-CC or EMT-P require that the physician perform the task, use his/her own equipment, and accompany the patient to the hospital in the ambulance. Any out-of-protocol procedures initiated by a non-designated physician remain the responsibility of that physician at the scene and during transport. Medical Control need not be contacted until the post-event telephone report if the above conditions are met, unless the ALS Provider is uncomfortable with the non-designated physician's actions. EMS Providers should always maintain a professional approach to other health care professionals during the transition of care phase of the alarm. All procedures and medications performed or administered by the physician must be clearly documented on the PCR or electronic equivalent.<br />
                            <br />If the on-scene physician is reluctant to agree to these terms, or is unwilling or unable to perform the task and orders an out-of-protocol procedure, the ALS Provider must contact Medical Control. The Medical Control Physician will make a judgment concerning the on-scene physician's participation and responsibility. Communication between the Medical Control Physician and on-scene physician is encouraged. If the on-scene physician refuses to communicate with the Medical Control Physician, the ALS Provider must inform the on-scene physician that the ALS Provider may only accept the orders of the Medical Control Physician.</li>

                        <p>In order to perform at the ALS Level, ALS providers must complete the REMAC-approved credentialing and authorization process and receive clearance by the EMS System Medical Director before they are allowed to function in the System. The ALS provider must be a member, employee or authorized representative of an agency that has an ALS agreement with the Suffolk County Department of Health Services, and may only operate in the System when acting as a member of such agency or when specifically requested to assist another agency that has an ALS agreement with the Suffolk County Department of Health Services. An ALS Provider who is no longer a member of an authorized ALS agency <b>MAY NOT</b> continue to function as an ALS Provider in the System. In order to maintain operating privileges, an ALS Provider must complete all EMS System/REMAC- authorized protocol or policy updates. ALS Providers are responsible to provide proper documentation to the EMS Division upon successful completion of original and refresher training. The credentialing and authorization process is fully described in the appendices section of the manual.</p>
                        <li><b><a name="THE ALS APPROACH">The ALS Approach</a>:</b> The protocols contained in the <b>Manual</b> are predicated on the presence of a single ALS Provider.

                    <p>NY State DOH policy for ambulance transport requires that patients be transported to the closest appropriate hospital Emergency Department. When a patient's condition requires <u>ADVANCED LEVEL CARE OR INTERVENTIONS, OR IS CONSIDERED TO BE LIFE THREATENING</u>, the ambulance service is obligated to transport the patient to the <b>nearest appropriate hospital Emergency Department, unless directed to another facility by state or regional protocols, or by a Medical Control Physician or Designated EMS Field Physician.</b></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Appropriateness is defined as the hospital most appropriate by NY State DOH designation (i.e.: Trauma Center, Pediatric Trauma Center, Stroke Center, Burn Center, PCI-Capable Center) where an admitting physician has privileges into a recognized specialty care area (i.e.: pediatrics), or in cases where there are no specific services at a particular hospital (i.e.: OB/GYN and Labor & Delivery).</li>
                        <li>Psychiatric Emergencies should be transported to the closest emergency department for medical evaluation and clearance for secondary transfer, as indicated by additional diagnostic testing.</li>
                        <li>Patients that may require hyperbaric therapy should be transported to the closest emergency department for evaluation and clearance for secondary transfer, as indicated by additional diagnostic testing.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Patients that are victims of sexual assault should be transported to a hospital that maintains a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) Program, unless the assault is compounded by an unstable illness or injury.</p>
                    <p>SANE Centers are maintained at Good Samaritan Hospital Medical Center, Peconic Bay Medical Center, and University Medical Center Stony Brook.</p>
                    <p>In many instances the patient's illness or injury is not immediately life threatening. In such situations, the following factors should be considered when selecting the destination hospital, provided that the drive time to the alternative receiving hospital does not exceed more than twenty (>20) minutes additional time than it would have taken to get to the original facility, per NY State BLS policy:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>NY State or Regional injury/illness specific protocols;</li>
                        <li>The patient's or family's request to be transported to a more distant hospital;</li>
                        <li>The hospital affiliation of the patient's private physician;</li>
                        <li>Travel time and road conditions; and</li>
                        <li>The ambulance agency's internal policy for the selection of a destination.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>A decision to transport a patient to a facility other than the nearest hospital implies that a judgment has been made that the risks of prolonged transport are outweighed by the potential benefits to the patient. Medical Control should be contacted for assistance in transport decisions when questions regarding the appropriateness of by-passing a hospital arise.</p>
                    <p>An ambulance service's duty to act is to the patient in their presence, not the “patient they might get,” therefore, agency internal policies should reflect care that is most appropriate and safe for the patient, not convenience of returning back to the district. The duty to act is not terminated until the transfer at the hospital bedside is complete. In the event that EMS providers at any level are unsure as to the appropriate destination hospital, they should contact Medical Control for physician advice.</p>
                    <p>In general terms, the duty to act begins upon receipt of a call for EMS assistance, and ends upon transfer of care to hospital staff, including verbal bedside summary and transfer of written report.</p>
                    <li><a name="HOSPITAL DIVERSION">HOSPITAL DIVERSION</a>:</li>
                    <p>Section 405.19 (e) (4) of the NYS Hospital Code authorizes hospitals to request diversion of ambulances to other facilities when the acceptance of another critical patient might endanger the life of that or another patient. A request for <b>diversion does not require that the ambulance</b> divert from that facility. EMS personnel are not obligated to honor such a request if they believe that a critically ill or injured patient's condition warrants transport to the closest hospital. <b>However,</b> EMS providers should consider the negative effects of bringing a patient to an emergency department that has declared that they are over capacity, or don't have enough equipment or space to properly care for additional patients. If it is determined that the patient is stable, the diversion request may be honored. Medical Control may be contacted to assist in the transport decision. Personnel <b>should fully document</b> the reason(s) for their decision on the PCR.</p>
                    <p>Hospital diversion is a dynamic process, and may be the result of general overcrowding during seasonal variances, or the result of the loss of specific diagnostic and/or treatment equipment, or infrastructure. Each hospital's decision to request diversion is made based upon different thresholds, in turn, based on each hospital's specific resources. Hospitals must take aggressive action within the institution to decompress patient load prior to requesting diversion. In cases of general overcrowding, where a particular hospital is overwhelmed with a full census and extenuating circumstances in the emergency department, it may be acceptable to temporarily divert patients to allow the hospital to decompress. However, in cases where hospitals with contiguous catchment areas are requesting diversion, it may not be appropriate to honor such requests.</p>
                    <p>In cases where a hospital-specific event of magnitude, or a loss of critical infrastructure or diagnostic equipment negatively affects a hospital's ability to receive patients, and the hospital makes an affirmative decision to temporarily place its emergency department out-of service, every effort will be made to effectively communicate information to ambulances and to redirect patients. Personnel <b>should expect to receive information</b> via Suffolk County FRES Communications, or appropriate Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP) / Dispatch Center and <b>should fully document</b> the reason(s) for their decision on the PCR.</p>
                    <li><a name="REFUSAL OF MEDICAL ASSISTANCE">REFUSAL OF MEDICAL ASSISTANCE</a> (RMA):</li>
                    <p>In the event that an ambulance service responds to a reported medical emergency where both the individuals at the scene and EMS personnel believe that no injuries or illnesses exist and that there are no individuals requiring or requesting EMS assistance, a PCR shall be prepared using the following <u>Disposition Codes</u>: 008 [Gone on Arrival (patient removed prior to arrival)] or 008 [Unfounded (false alarm) (no patient found)]. A thorough assessment of the scene is required to rule out mechanism of injury criteria. A physical assessment may also be necessary to make the determination that there are no patients at the scene. Consider the <u>High Risk Criteria</u> identified below before determining that there are no patients at the scene. Refer to the “No Patient Found” policy in the appendices section of the manual for guidance on determining patients from individuals.</p>
                    <p>If in the judgment of EMS personnel there is a patient at the scene that requires treatment and/or ambulance transport, but who refuses such services, Medical Control must be contacted in an attempt to convince the patient to consent to appropriate care and / or transport.</p>
                    <p>The Medical Control Physician will assess the patient's capability to refuse treatment, encourage the patient to allow appropriate care as indicated, and offer advice and guidance to EMS personnel. If the Medical Control Physician determines that the patient warrants treatment and/or transport, every effort should be made, using all available resources at the scene, to encourage the patient to consent to treatment and/or transport to the hospital. If all efforts are unsuccessful, the refusal should be thoroughly documented on the PCR, signed by the patient and witnessed, preferably by a family member or a police officer.</p>
                    <p>Documentation should also include a complete patient assessment, and a statement that the patient has received explanation of the risks associated with refusal of transport, and that there is some level of support in place for them, including an alternative plan. <b><u>The use of the Suffolk County RMA Checklist, or an agency-specific checklist approved by Suffolk County EMS, must accompany PCRs or electronic report submissions for all RMA cases</u>,</b> whether or not Medical Control was contacted. For high risk cases, where contact with Medical Control is required, the RMA Checklist should be completed to the degree possible prior to contacting Medical Control, so that essential information is obtained and can be readily communicated. A sample RMA checklist can be found in the appendices section of the manual.</p>
                    <p>From time to time, patients may receive treatment and then refuse further treatment or transportation to the hospital. In the event that a patient receives treatment but refuses transportation by ambulance, and the EMS provider agrees that ambulance transportation is not warranted and no high-risk illness or injury exists, Medical Control need not be contacted. The patient's decision to refuse, the risks of refusal, and any recommended follow-up offered to the patient, should be noted on the PCR and the RMA signed by the patient, indicating he/she has refused transportation. If the EMS provider believes that ambulance transport is indicated, or high- risk illness or injury exists, Medical Control must be contacted. In <u>all</u> cases where there is no transport to a hospital, the yellow copy of the PCR must be sent to Medical Control by the ambulance service, or entered into the electronic reporting format, in the prescribed format and time frame.</p>
                    <p>The Medical Orders for Life Sustaining Treatment (MOLST) Form or electronic MOLST Form (eMOLST) is an advanced directive where a patient or the surrogate decision maker has communicated end-of-life wishes extending well beyond the DNR, with implications for the ALS provider regarding limited medical interventions, pain management, fluid resuscitation and transportation to the hospital.</p>
                    <p>Patients with a valid MOLST/eMOLST Form may elect to determine which treatments they are willing to accept or refuse, and you are obligated to honor that request. This includes decisions to attempt treatment, withhold treatment, initiate a trial course of treatment, or elect to NOT be transported to a hospital.</p>
                    <p>In cases where there may be high-risk RMA Criteria, and an individual has expressed his/her end-of-life wishes on a MOLST/eMOLST Form, this is not considered an RMA and Medical Control need not be contacted.</p>

                        <p>The process for determining that medevac service is appropriate for a particular patient includes consideration of the patient's condition, distance from a designated specialty hospital, physical findings, mechanism of injury, contraindications for medevac service and the logistics of removing a patient unique to the given situation. Medevac operations are costly and inherently dangerous. Effort must be made to first consider ground transport times and the ability of a ground ambulance crew to continue care while enroute to the hospital, before requesting medevac services. In determining the appropriateness of medevac service in trauma responses, you must first evaluate the following:</p>
                        <b>EXCLUSION CRITERIA. It is inappropriate to request medevac service if the patient:</b>

                        </ul>
                        <p>Patients who fit the exclusion criteria should be transported as promptly as possible by ground ambulance to the nearest hospital.</p>
                        <b>INCLUSION CRITERIA. It is appropriate to consider medevac request if the patient's condition:</b>

                            <li>Requires expeditious transport to a hospital capable of providing specialized care, such as a designated Adult, or Adult and Pediatric Trauma Center; Stroke Center; Burn Center; STEMI Center; hospital with Obstetric (OB) services, etc.;</li>
                            <li>Requires specialized services (medications or procedures) offered by the air medical crew not available to the ground crew prior to arrival at the hospital;</li>

                        <p><b>Medical Control should be contacted to assist with transport decisions when use of medevac services are not specifically defined by the protocols and questions as to appropriateness arise.</b></p>
                        <p><b>For specialty hospital referrals, the patient must still meet NY State or Suffolk County criteria for selection of destination hospital.</b></p>
                        <p class="black">In all cases, the goal of prehospital care, selection of transportation mode, and selection of destination hospital should be focused on getting the patient to the hospital best capable of caring for the particular injury or illness in the most expedient manner.</p>

                        <p>All unauthorized administration of medication, unauthorized use of any procedure, or deviation from protocol must be reported for review by the EMS System Medical Director. Such review may result in the temporary suspension of ALS operating privileges, temporary suspension or restriction of standing orders, a warning, or mandatory remedial education. Intentional deviation from protocol or obstruction of the quality assurance process may result in the suspension / restriction of ALS operating privileges or expulsion from the ALS System. <b><i><u>Agencies that restrict or suspend ALS provider privileges per internal agency level CQI audits MUST notify the Suffolk County EMS Division in writing, summarizing the infraction, restriction process, and remedial plan of action.</u></i></b></p>

                        <p>The ambulance service, and in turn, the EMS System Medical Director is obligated, under New York State Department of Health EMS Policy to report specific types of occurrences, including activity that is contrary to a technician's level of certification to the State Health Department for investigation. Such action may lead to the revocation of an EMT / AEMT certificate and / or the pursuit of civil or criminal action.</p>

                        <p>Prevention of unrecognized esophageal intubation is of paramount importance and is a medical and legal necessity. Therefore, the use of End-Tidal CO2 waveform capnography, the use of a commercially available tube holder, <b><u>and</u></b> immobilization of the head with cervical collar, head blocks and long backboard, <b><u>is required on all endotracheal intubations performed in the ALS System</u></b>. For patients where a waveform is initially obtained, then disappears, the ET tube should be removed.</p>
                        <p><u>For patients with a pulse requiring intubation</u>, whether or not they have received medication to facilitate intubation, <b><i>pulse oximetry, continuous ETCO2 waveform capnography, and cardiac monitoring is required prior to intubation, and is to be maintained throughout transport to the hospital.</i></b> ET Tubes are to be secured in the manner described above.</p>
                        <p>The use of continuous ETCO2 capnography is strongly recommended for all non-intubated patients complaining of respiratory distress.</p>
                        <p>For patients with a supraglottic airway, the use of ETCO2 waveform capnography, immobilization of the head, and post-insertion verification procedures remain in effect.</p>
                        <p>The Suffolk REMAC Verification of Intubation Form must be completed and signed by the confirming party, and submitted to the EMS Division Office with a copy of the PCR and ETCO2 waveform capnography as soon as feasible after the alarm.</p>

                    <li><a name="DO NOT RESUSCITATE (DNR) ORDERS / ADVANCED DIRECTIVES">DO NOT RESUSCITATE (DNR) ORDERS / ADVANCED DIRECTIVES</a>:</li>
                    <p>Non-hospital DNR orders and an advanced directive called the Medical Orders For Life Sustaining Treatment (MOLST) are permitted by the Family Health Care Decisions Act (FHCDA) and governed by Public Health Law (PHL) Article 29-CCC. A DNR order is an order not to perform ventilations, compressions, defibrillation, intubation or medication administration in the event of cardiac <b><u>OR</u></b> respiratory arrest, including mechanical ventilation after removal of a foreign body airway obstruction if ventilations are not spontaneously restored.</p>
                    <p>The MOLST Form, or eMOLST, more formally described previously in Section 5, is an advanced directive where a patient or the surrogate decision maker has communicated end-of-life wishes extending well beyond the DNR, with implications for the ALS provider regarding limited medical interventions, pain management, fluid resuscitation and transportation to the hospital.</p>
                    <p><b>The approved NYSDOH NON-HOSPITAL DNR ORDER, or an approved DNR bracelet, or the bright pink multi-page MOLST Form, or electronic access to eMOLST are to be honored.</b> The DNR form must be signed and dated by the patient's attending physician. Nursing Homes and other Article 28 licensed facilities may use their own DNR form and EMS providers must honor that form. The MOLST Form also must be signed by the decision maker and the physician. Like the DNR Form, the MOLST Form is subject to periodic review with no date/time parameter attached.</p>
                    <p>Therefore, DNR Forms and MOLST Forms should be considered valid as long as they have been signed and there is no indication to suggest the order has been modified.</p>
                    <p>Absence of a valid DNR Form, MOLST Form, or eMOLST requires that full treatment be rendered. CPR must be initiated in the absence of a Non-Hospital DNR, or a facility DNR, or MOLST Form; however, CPR may be stopped once the DNR or MOLST Form is produced.</p>
                    <p>Public Health Law (PHL) 2994-gg provides immunity from liability for good faith actions concerning DNR and MOLST orders. If it is believed that a DNR order or MOLST Form is invalid, and CPR is performed, the technician will not be held liable. If a DNR order or MOLST Form is disputed, CPR may be started in order to avoid a physical confrontation. Contact with Medical Control should be made to resolve any disputes with a DNR or MOLST / eMOLST Form.</p>
                    <li><a name="OBVIOUS DEATH">OBVIOUS DEATH</a>:</li>
                    <p>When a cardiac arrest situation is encountered, certified EMS providers are obligated to perform CPR, <b>unless</b> a valid NYS DNR form or MOLST Form indicating DNR is presented, or unless there are signs of obvious death, such as decapitation or similarly mortal injuries, or where rigor mortis, tissue decomposition or extreme dependent lividity are present. If CPR has been initiated by an untrained bystander or family member in the presence of signs of obvious death, the EMS provider may elect to discontinue CPR. <b><u><i>AEDs or cardiac monitors are not to be used in this decision-making process.</i></u></b></p>
                    <p>There is no expectation that ambulances transport the deceased to the hospital. However, in cases where a person with a valid DNR or MOLST Form indicating DNR expires in a public location, or in the ambulance after transportation is already underway, transportation to the hospital without resuscitative measures is allowed.</p>

                    <p>In effort to balance EMS provider safety and safety to the general public, with recognition of futile resuscitative efforts, termination of unsuccessful resuscitation may occur in accordance with the parameters set forth in the Field Termination of Resuscitation Protocol, <b>with the consent of the family present.</b> Termination of Resuscitation (TOR) is appropriate only for applicable patients in a private residence where full ALS resuscitation (IV, advanced airway, medications, etc.) efforts do not result in prehospital return of spontaneous circulation (PROSC). In these cases, documentation should include all resuscitative measures, and the patient's response to those measures. The patient need not be transported to the hospital, and left in the care of police officers on the scene. TOR is a standing order for EMT-Ps. EMT-CCs must contact Medical Control for a physician decision to terminate resuscitation. <u>Note that this procedure does not apply to patients in a public setting.</u></p>
                    <p>Intravenous lines and endotracheal tubes should be left in place. <b>If the family requests that the resuscitation effort be continued, and that the patient be transported to the hospital, the family's request is to be honored.</b></p>

                    <p>Only those controlled substances approved by the NY State Emergency Medical Advisory Committee (SEMAC) and the NY State Department of Health (NYSDOH) may be administered by appropriately certified and authorized ALS Providers of certified ALS ambulance services or certified ALS first response services participating in the Suffolk County ALS System, with a Class 3C Controlled Substance License. Controlled Substances may be administered either under standing orders, or upon the order of a Medical Control Physician or Designated EMS Field Physician, per applicable clinical protocols. Controlled substances <u>may not be carried in the private vehicles</u> of EMS providers, <u>including private vehicles authorized by the ambulance service as first responder vehicles (EASV), as described below.</u> Marked and certified ambulances or EASVs must be used to transport controlled substances. All certified personnel and all authorized officers, members and / or employees of an ALS agency are under a <b>continuous duty to immediately report</b> to the EMS System Medical Director, the Service Medical Director, the Controlled Substances Agent and the NYSDOH / BEMS any loss, theft, and / or diversion of controlled substances. ALS Providers must be engaged in “active response” with the agency that holds the Class 3C Controlled Substances license in order to administer controlled substances.</p>

                    <p>Except as provided for in the next paragraph, ALS personnel are <b>not</b> authorized to carry any item that requires a physician's prescription in their private vehicle. Such items include, but are not limited to, needles, syringes, medications, and defibrillators.</p>
                    <p>The only circumstance under which such equipment may be legitimately carried in a private vehicle is when the vehicle operator is serving as an authorized agent of an agency participating in the Suffolk County ALS System, functioning as an “ALS first-responder.” In those cases, the member's personal vehicle is considered an Emergency Ambulance Service Vehicle (EASV) and must meet the criteria set forth in NY State policy. The ALS equipment may be carried <b>only</b> with the prior knowledge and approval of a chief officer of the ALS Provider's agency, and with the authorization of the NYSDOH. All such ALS equipment must be able to be used under protocols applicable to the ALS Provider's level of certification, and must include, but is not limited to, IV administration supplies and fluids, monitor / defibrillator, endotracheal intubation/airway adjunct equipment, and telemetry / communications equipment.</p>

                    <p>An ALS Provider credentialed and authorized by the EMS Medical Director to participate in the Suffolk County ALS System may legally operate only within the geographical confines of the Suffolk County EMS System, or out of Suffolk County as part of a bona fide mutual aid response. An ALS Provider may not perform ALS as a “passer-by” when the technician is outside of his / her agency's district, unless the provider's assistance is requested by an agency that participates in the Suffolk County ALS System, per guidelines in section 209i in General Municipal Law. Refer to Suffolk County EMS Policy “Inter-agency Utilization of Advanced Life Support Personnel,” outlined in the appendices section of this manual. Based on inter-regional agreements, in cases where the ALS Provider is operating outside Suffolk County on a bona fide mutual aid response, the Suffolk County ALS Protocols are to be used, and contact with Suffolk County Medical Control, when indicated, is expected.</p>

                    <p>If a CFR or EMT-B initiated patient care prior to the arrival of an EMT-CC or EMT-P, the EMT-CC or EMT-P should allow personnel to continue to perform those Standing Orders which have been initiated. <b>Common sense and good patient care are to prevail in all provider interactions. When questions arise, patient care activity should be directed by the individual with the highest certification.

The New York State Department of Health (NYSDOH) BLS Protocols have been adopted as the standard of care for BLS in Suffolk County.</p>
                    <p>The ALS Protocols set forth in this <b>Manual</b> constitute the standard of care for all advanced out-of hospital emergency medical care provided by Advanced Emergency Medical Technicians authorized in the Suffolk County Advanced Life Support (ALS) System.</p>
                    <p>In situations where a patient's condition may fit more than one of the protocols set forth in the <b>Manual</b>, the ALS Provider shall identify the most emergent clinical problem and use that as the protocol of entry into the ALS System. For patients presenting with multiple clinical problems, contact should be established with Medical Control as promptly as possible, even if Standing Orders have not been initiated. ALS Providers <b>MAY NOT transition through multiple protocols, except in the cardiac arrest situation, where transition from the presenting arrhythmia, to ONE (1) ADDITIONAL arrhythmia, is allowed PRIOR TO CONTACT WITH MEDICAL CONTROL.</b></p>
                    <p>The protocols set forth in this <b>Manual</b> have been developed for adult and pediatric patients. Generally, the adult is defined as an individual who is fifteen or more (≥ 15) years old and who weighs more than thirty six (36) Kg. Medical Control <b>options</b> are those treatments and / or procedures that the online Medical Control Physician <b>may</b> order. Medication dosages may be modified by the Medical Control Physician for adult and pediatric patients that are outside their respective age, weight expectations. <b><u>Please refer to adult protocols. Contact with Medical Control shall be made</u></b> for any adult patient greater than (>) fifteen (15) years of age but weighing less than (<) thirty six (36) Kg.</p>

A <b>Broselow Tape</b> must be carried as part of the standard ALS equipment package and must be used to estimate the pediatric patient's body weight, guide medication dosage adjustments, determine energy selection requirements, and tube sizes. IO access may be utilized on any pediatric patient who meets the age criteria above and weight criteria on the Broselow Tape (3-36 Kg.). <b><u>Please refer to pediatric protocols and the relevant appendices.</u></b></p>
                    <p>Any patient greater than twelve (> 12) years old and weighing greater than (>) thirty six (36) Kg. may be treated as an adult.</p>
                    <p>In cases where the medication is indicated for a pediatric patient, but not listed in the Broselow Tape, the tape will be used only for weight estimates and the dose listed in the protocol, or ordered by Medical Control, will be used.</p>

These protocols are not intended for routine transportation use or interfacility transfer situations. In cases where an EMS System ambulance may be necessary to transport a patient between home and a health care facility, or between health care facilities, or any other non-emergent situation, requiring BLS Level care and interventions, <b><u>PRIOR APPROVAL FROM THE EMS SYSTEM MEDICAL DIRECTOR, OR DESIGNEE, IS REQUIRED.</u></b> Interfacility transportation at the ALS level is outside the scope of these protocols and is generally not acceptable but may be approved by the EMS System Medical Director on a case by case basis depending on the patient's condition.</p>

                    <p>All providers operating at the scene of a medical emergency should be conscious of their surroundings at all times. “Scene safety” is more than just a simple yes or no question that occurs upon approach. On- going assessment of the scene is equally important as on-going assessment of the patient. EMS Providers should apply the theory of a “contact provider” to provide primary patient care and a “cover provider” to remain less distracted by the patient and more attentive to people, affect, crowd formation, egress paths and the like. If the scene turns from docile to hostile, and EMS providers safety is in jeopardy, hasty retreat is not abandonment. EMS providers should remain on the scene in a safe area of refuge, until scene safety can be re-established, and patient care can continue. Thorough documentation on the PCR / ePCR is required.</p>

                    <p>ALS providers should be mindful of how their therapies and interventions ultimately affect the patient. The foundation of ALS is to stabilize an unstable patient and safely transport them to the hospital. Therefore, the decision to use emergency lights and sirens should be based on the patient's clinical needs and ALS providers' judgement regarding the severity of their illness / injury in terms of immediate threats to life and limb.</p>
                    <p>Whenever possible, EMS providers should perform patient care skills at the scene. If skills need to be performed in a moving ambulance, providers should be appropriately restrained. As an alternative, as long as it is safe and appropriate to do so, the ambulance should be pulled off the road and stopped for the duration of necessary interventions and procedures. As a matter of safety, EMS providers should plan their patient care so that essential interventions are performed prior to beginning transport and have ready access to patient care equipment that may be needed while enroute to the hospital.</p>

                <p><i>This protocol is intended for use when cyanide toxicity is suspected from smoke inhalation, accidental or intentional poisoning, or mass intoxication, when sufficient resources and proper personal protective equipment are available to ensure the safety of the EMS personnel attending to the patient.</i></p>

                <p>Exposure to high concentrations of cyanide causes coma, seizures, apnea, and cardiac arrest, with death following in a matter of minutes.</p>
                <p>With exposure to lower doses, patients experience general weakness, giddiness, headache, vertigo, confusion, and perceived difficulty breathing, progressing to altered mental status or loss of consciousness. In the early stages of unconsciousness, breathing is often sufficient or even rapid, although the state of the victim progresses towards a deep coma, sometimes accompanied by pulmonary edema, and finally cardiac arrest.</p>
